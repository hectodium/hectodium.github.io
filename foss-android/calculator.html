						<p>
                            It might seem silly at first to replace your phone's default calculator app. What are the risks of using a proprietary calculator app?
                            It is not about the risks, it is a matter of principle. All stock calculator apps out there are probably based on the AOSP calculator with a few design changes and features.
                            There is nothing wrong about it, but replacing your current app for a FOSS alternative can give you extra perks like more complex operations or unit conversion, plus the possibility of editing the source code yourself if you want to implement a specific feature.
